# Class Scheduler app

## REQUIREMENTS

We want to build a library (software module, classes, objects, etc.) for
tracking a studentâ€™s courses at college.

A student can take a course.  A course meets some number of hours per week
(example. Monday 2-3, Wed 2-4).  A student can enroll in multiple courses.
Students must not be able to add a new course if it conflicts with an
existing course.

Write code that implements this requirement.

## NOTES

* Classes may meet multiple times per day
* All classes start on the hour and may go multiple hours
* These are internally used libraries so no need to check for malicious or invalid values
